A repo containing my resume and portfolio

As a computer science student at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, I am developing a passion for cybersecurity, 
working on Linux and becoming more familiar with tools such as the command line and programs such as vim and wireshark. 
Python's simplicity and versatility have made it my language of choice for programming and scripting. Continuing to develop 
these skills, I hope to use them in the field to promote data security, and user privacy, through free and open source software.
